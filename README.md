# Follow My Lead
An app for creating and sharing custom adventures in your favorite places.

## Summary
Follow My Lead is a way for people to share journies and experiences with others by creating custom routes in their favorite cities for others to follow. Routes can be intended for tourists visiting a new area or for history buffs to find notable locations or just of a personal nature.  Each destination within a route can be enhanced by adding contextual language and insider recommendations.  User can browse existing routes or create their own.
Future iterations will allow for creating an account, commenting on routes, searching by location, and more.
